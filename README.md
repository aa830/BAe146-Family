# BAe-146 family
The BAe-146 family implemented for FlightGear.

## Status
It has been over 2 years since any major development went on. I am now a Junior in High School and its really a shame, but I have lost interest in this project and do not have any more time left for it. This project is now "abandoned" and has been archived. If anybody would like to fork it to (hopefully) continue the work, feel free to do so, but please note: There will be no further development on this Repository. Thank you for all the fellow more experienced developers who helped me start out. Thank you the the FlightGear community for your never-ending support. 

  Regards,
        aa830

## Progress
Finished v1 of FDM, Aircraft Model present. Sounds from JMaverick's A330 added Engine sounds present. Need to work on interior.


## Installation
* Create a separate folder for self-installed aircraft somewhere if you don't have one already
  (/home/user/fgfs-addons/Aircraft for example, the folder MUST be named Aircraft !)
* Clone the repo:
  ```sh
  cd /home/user/fgfs-addons/Aircraft
  git clone https://github.com/aa830/BAe146-Family
  ```
* Add `/home/user/fgfs-addons/Aircraft` to the list of aircraft folders in the Addons tab of the launcher,
  or add `--aircraft-dir=/home/user/fgfs-addons/Aircraft` on the command line.
  
* Alternatively, download the code from this page, extract the ZIP, rename the file to BAe-146-Family and put it in your Aircraft folder
  
* Use it ! :)
