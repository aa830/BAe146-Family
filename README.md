## Status
WIP

## Progress
Finished v1 of FDM, Aircraft Model present. Sounds from JMaverick's A330 added (Need engine sounds). Need to work on interior.


## Installation
* Create a separate folder for self-installed aircraft somewhere if you don't have one already
  (/home/user/fgfs-addons/Aircraft for example, the folder MUST be named Aircraft !)
* Clone the repo:
  ```sh
  cd /home/user/fgfs-addons/Aircraft
  git clone https://github.com/aa830/BAe146-Family
  ```
* Add `/home/user/fgfs-addons/Aircraft` to the list of aircraft folders in the Addons tab of the launcher,
  or add `--aircraft-dir=/home/user/fgfs-addons/Aircraft` on the command line.
  
* Alternatively, download the code from this page, extract the ZIP, rename the file to BAe-146-Family and put it in your Aircraft folder
  
* Use it ! :)
